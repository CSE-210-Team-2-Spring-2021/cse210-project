# Definitely Not a Sinistar Clone

Your goal in Sinistar is simple: destroy the Sinistar before it destroys you. The Sinistar is a large silver and red face with devil-like horns that will chase down your ship and—literally—eat it. It is constructed one piece at a time by small red bugs called Workers. Workers assemble the Sinistar one piece at a time from the crystals that they find floating in space.

Crystals don't start out floating in space; originally, they are buried deep with the Planetoids drifting through space around you. They can be broken loose (or mined) by firing into the Planetoids. Workers can't mine crystals themselves, so they wait for you to do it and then try to steal the crystals before you can get to them. You'll want to prevent the Workers from stealing crystals for two reasons:

1. To prevent them from building the Sinistar.
2. The crystals you collect are converted to Sinibombs
   which can be used to destroy the Sinistar later.

The only dangers to your ship in Sinistar are the Warriors and Sinistar itself. The Warriors will try to shoot you while you're mining crystals, but they can be quickly destroyed with the fire button. The Sinistar, on the other hand, can only be destroyed by a direct hit from a Sinibomb on every piece of it. This is the main goal of the game.

## Getting Started

---

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and arcade 2.6.0 or new installed
and running on your machine. You can install arcade by opening a terminal
and running the following command.

```
python3 -m pip install arcade
```

After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the
project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

```
python3 sinistar
```

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and
click the "run" icon.
